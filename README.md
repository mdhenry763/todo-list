Why Edge Functions Are More Secure Over Direct Queries from Flutter

Hidden Business Logic: Your validation rules and business logic stay on the server
Additional Security Layer: You can add extra auth checks, rate limiting, and validation
Protected Database Access: Database credentials never exposed to the client
Server-Side Validation: Can't be bypassed by malicious clients
Audit Logging: Centralized logging of all operations
Fine-grained Control: Can implement complex permissions beyond RLS
